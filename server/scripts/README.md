## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Warning
These scripts perform **PERMANENT DELETIONS**. Data cannot be recovered after running these scripts.

### Best Practices
1. **Backup your database** before running any clear scripts
2. Run in **development environment** first
3. Verify the script output before confirming
4. Use specific scripts instead of `clear-db` when possible

### Recommended Order for Complete Reset
If you want to clear everything in the correct order:

```bash
cd server
npm run clear-notifications    # 1. Clear notifications first
npm run clear-payments         # 2. Clear payments
npm run clear-registrations    # 3. Clear registrations
npm run clear-events           # 4. Clear events
npm run clear-users            # 5. Clear users (keeps admins)
```

Or simply:
```bash
npm run clear-db  # Does all of the above in one command
```
