# Authentication Removal Summary

## Overview
The codebase has been modified to remove user authentication (login/signup) and make event registration direct. Users can now register for events by providing their information directly in the registration form without creating an account.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Model Changes

#### Registration Model (`server/models/Registration.js`)
- **Added direct user fields**: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `college`
- **Removed**: `user` reference to User model
- **Updated index**: Changed from `{user: 1, event: 1}` to `{email: 1, event: 1}` to prevent duplicate registrations by email

### 2. Backend API Changes

#### Registration Routes (`server/routes/registrations.js`)
- **POST `/api/registrations`**: Now public (no authentication required)
  - Accepts: `eventId`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `college`, `teamName`, `teamMembers`
  - Validates user info directly
  - Checks for duplicate registrations by email
  - Checks for time conflicts by email
  - Sends confirmation email to provided email address

- **GET `/api/registrations/check-conflict/:eventId`**: Now public
  - Accepts `email` as query parameter
  - Returns conflict information for the given email

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### App.jsx
- **Removed routes**: `/login`, `/signup`, `/verify-otp`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/dashboard`
- **Kept routes**: 
  - `/admin/login` - For admin access only
  - `/admin/*` - Protected admin routes
  - `/payment/:registrationId` - Now public (no authentication required)

#### EventDetails Page (`client/src/pages/EventDetails.jsx`)
- **Removed**: Authentication check before registration
- **Added**: Registration modal that collects user information
- **User Info Fields**: name, email, phone, college
- **For Team Events**: Collects team name and additional team member details
- **Conflict Check**: Uses email instead of user authentication
- **Registration Flow**:
  1. User clicks "Register Now"
  2. Modal opens with user info form
  3. For team events, shows team name and team members section
  4. Submits all information directly to API
  5. Redirects to payment page (if paid event) or shows success message

#### Navbar Components
- **DesktopNavbar.jsx**: Removed login/signup buttons, kept only admin menu
- **MobileNavbar.jsx**: Removed login/signup buttons, kept only admin menu
- Both navbars now only show user info if the user is an admin

#### Payment Page (`client/src/pages/Payment.jsx`)
- **Updated navigation**: Redirects to `/events` instead of `/dashboard`
- Works without authentication (fetches registration by ID)

### 4. What Was Kept

#### Admin Authentication
- Admin login still works at `/admin/login`
- Admin routes remain protected
- Admin panel functionality unchanged
- User model still exists for admin users

#### AuthContext
- Still exists to support admin authentication
- Regular users don't interact with it

### 5. Registration Flow (New)

#### Individual Event Registration:
1. User visits event details page
2. Clicks "Register Now"
3. Fills in personal information (name, email, phone, college)
4. Submits registration
5. Receives confirmation email
6. If paid event, redirected to payment page

#### Team Event Registration:
1. User visits event details page
2. Clicks "Register Now"
3. Fills in personal information (leader info)
4. Enters team name
5. Adds additional team members with their details
6. Submits registration
7. Receives confirmation email
8. If paid event, redirected to payment page

### 6. Email Notifications
- Confirmation emails sent to the email provided during registration
- No user account required
- Notification model updated to work without user reference

### 7. Data Storage
- All registrations store complete user information
- No dependency on User model for regular participants
- Email serves as the unique identifier for participants
- Duplicate prevention based on email + event combination

## Benefits

1. **Simplified User Experience**: No account creation needed
2. **Faster Registration**: Direct event registration
3. **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Users can register immediately
4. **Maintained Admin Control**: Admin functionality unchanged
5. **Email-Based Tracking**: All communications via email provided during registration

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data:
If you have existing registrations with user references, you'll need to:
1. Migrate user data (name, email, phone, college) from User model to Registration model
2. Update the Registration model index
3. Remove user references from registrations

### Database Migration Script Needed:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for migration
const registrations = await Registration.find().populate('user');
for (const reg of registrations) {
  if (reg.user) {
    reg.name = reg.user.name;
    reg.email = reg.user.email;
    reg.phone = reg.user.phone;
    reg.college = reg.user.college;
    await reg.save();
  }
}
```
