```bash
cd /path/to/your/server
```

**Step 3: Edit .env file**
```bash
nano .env
```

**Step 4: Add these lines** (replace with your actual values)
```bash
# Cloudinary Configuration - REQUIRED for VPS
USE_CLOUDINARY=true
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here

npm start
```

**Step 7: Verify configuration**
```bash

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### 1. Test Cloudinary Configuration

**Via API:**
```bash
# Get your admin token first (login to admin dashboard)
# Then test:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/events/test-cloudinary
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "cloudinaryEnabled": true,
  "cloudName": "Set",
  "apiKey": "Set",
  "apiSecret": "Set",
  "message": "‚úÖ Cloudinary is properly configured"
}
```

### 2. Test Image Upload

1. Go to your admin dashboard: `https://your-domain.com/admin`
2. Navigate to Events ‚Üí Add Event or Edit Event
3. Try uploading an image
4. Check browser console (F12)

**Expected console output:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  message: "Image uploaded successfully",
  imageUrl: "https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/...",
  storage: "cloudinary"  // ‚Üê Should say "cloudinary" not "local"
}
```

### 3. Test Sponsor Logos

1. Visit your homepage: `https://your-domain.com`
2. Scroll to sponsors section
3. Check browser Network tab (F12 ‚Üí Network)
4. Look for image requests

**Expected:**
- URLs start with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`
- Images load in < 1 second
- No 404 errors

### 4. Test QR Code Upload

1. Go to admin ‚Üí Edit Event
2. Upload a QR code
3. Verify it displays immediately
4. Check the URL in console

**Expected:**
- QR code uploads successfully
- URL is from Cloudinary
- Displays without delay

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cloudinary is NOT properly configured"

**Check 1: Environment variables**
```bash
cd /path/to/server
cat .env | grep CLOUDINARY
```

Should show:
```
USE_CLOUDINARY=true
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abcdefgh
```

**Check 2: No spaces around =**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Correct
USE_CLOUDINARY=true

# ‚ùå Wrong
USE_CLOUDINARY = true
```

**Check 3: Restart server**
```bash
pm2 restart all
pm2 logs
```

Look for: `‚úÖ Cloudinary configuration complete`

---

### Issue: "Images still loading from localhost"

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5)
3. Check `.env` has `USE_CLOUDINARY=true`
4. Restart server
5. Re-upload images

---

### Issue: "Upload works but image doesn't display"

**Check 1: HTTPS vs HTTP**
- Cloudinary URLs must use HTTPS
- Check browser console for mixed content warnings

**Check 2: CORS**
- Cloudinary should allow all origins by default
- If blocked, configure in Cloudinary dashboard

**Check 3: Image URL format**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Correct
https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/v123/savishkar/events/event-123.jpg

// ‚ùå Wrong
http://localhost:5000/uploads/events/event-123.jpg
```

---

### Issue: "Slow uploads even with Cloudinary"

**Possible causes:**
1. **Slow internet** - Check your connection speed
2. **Large files** - Compress images before upload
3. **Rate limits** - Cloudinary free tier has limits
4. **Server location** - Cloudinary auto-selects nearest server

**Solutions:**
- Compress images to < 500 KB
- Use WebP format
- Upgrade Cloudinary plan if needed
