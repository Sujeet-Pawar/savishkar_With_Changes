📋 Code for Home.jsx:

const sponsors = [
  { id: 1, name: 'BGAUSS', logo: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/...' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Creative', logo: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/...' },
  ...
];
```

### Step 2: Update Home.jsx with Cloudinary URLs

The script will generate the exact code you need. Copy the `sponsors` array from the output and replace it in `client/src/pages/Home.jsx`.

**Example:**
```javascript
// In client/src/pages/Home.jsx
const sponsors = [
  { id: 1, name: 'BGAUSS', logo: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/YOUR_CLOUD/image/upload/v123/savishkar/sponsors/bgauss.jpg' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Creative', logo: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/YOUR_CLOUD/image/upload/v123/savishkar/sponsors/creative.png' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Jai Bharat', logo: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/YOUR_CLOUD/image/upload/v123/savishkar/sponsors/jai-bharat.jpg' },
  // ... rest of sponsors
];
```

### Step 3: Test

```bash
# Build and test locally
cd client
npm run build

# Or test in dev mode
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and scroll to the sponsors section. The logos should load from Cloudinary.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Upload Process:

1. **Scans Directory** - Finds all images in `client/public/sponsors/`
2. **Optimizes** - Cloudinary automatically optimizes each image
3. **Uploads** - Stores in `savishkar/sponsors/` folder
4. **Generates URLs** - Creates permanent CDN URLs
5. **Saves Reference** - Saves URLs to `server/uploads/sponsor-cloudinary-urls.json`

### Optimizations Applied:
- **Max dimensions**: 800x800px (maintains aspect ratio)
- **Quality**: Auto (Cloudinary chooses best quality/size balance)
- **Format**: Auto (serves WebP to supported browsers, fallback to original)
- **Compression**: Automatic lossless compression

## 🌐 Deployment to Hostinger VPS

### Why This Works on Hostinger:

1. **No Local Files Needed** - All logos are on Cloudinary CDN
2. **Fast Loading** - Cloudinary's global CDN is faster than your VPS
3. **No Storage Used** - Saves disk space on your VPS
4. **Automatic Scaling** - Images are optimized for each device

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Upload logos to Cloudinary** (Step 1 above)
2. **Update Home.jsx** with Cloudinary URLs (Step 2 above)
3. **Build your React app**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Deploy to Hostinger VPS**:
   ```bash
   # Copy build files to your VPS
   scp -r dist/* user@your-vps:/var/www/html/
   ```

That's it! The sponsors will load from Cloudinary, not your VPS.

## 🔄 Adding New Sponsors

### Process:

1. **Add logo to directory**:
   ```bash
   # Copy new sponsor logo
   cp /path/to/new-sponsor.png client/public/sponsors/
   ```

2. **Upload to Cloudinary**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run upload-sponsors
   ```

3. **Update Home.jsx**:
   - Copy the new sponsor entry from script output
   - Add to `sponsors` array in `Home.jsx`

4. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   # Deploy to your VPS
   ```

## 📊 Reference Files

After running the upload script, you'll find:

### `server/uploads/sponsor-cloudinary-urls.json`
Contains all uploaded URLs in JSON format:
```json
[
  {
    "filename": "BGAUSS.jpg",
    "publicId": "savishkar/sponsors/bgauss",
    "url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
    "size": "12.64 KB"
  },
  ...
]
```

You can use this file to:
- Reference URLs later
- Verify uploads
- Generate code snippets

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Cloudinary configuration incomplete"

**Solution:**
1. Check if `.env` file exists in `server/` directory
2. Ensure these variables are set:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
3. Get credentials from: https://cloudinary.com/console

### Issue 2: "Sponsors directory not found"

**Solution:**
1. Verify directory exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la client/public/sponsors/
   ```
2. If missing, create it:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p client/public/sponsors
   ```
3. Add sponsor logos to the directory

### Issue 3: "No sponsor logo images found"

**Solution:**
1. Check if images exist:
   ```bash
   ls client/public/sponsors/
   ```
2. Ensure files have valid extensions: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`
3. PDF files are not uploaded (only images)

### Issue 4: Images not loading on website

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify URLs in Home.jsx are correct
3. Test URL directly in browser
4. Ensure Cloudinary URLs are public (not private)

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Image Formats
- **PNG**: For logos with transparency
- **JPG**: For photos without transparency
- **WebP**: Modern format (Cloudinary auto-converts)

### 2. Image Sizes
- **Recommended**: 200-500 KB per logo
- **Max**: 1 MB per logo
- Larger files are automatically optimized by Cloudinary

### 3. Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `company-name.png`
- Avoid spaces: Use hyphens or underscores
- Lowercase preferred: `bgauss.jpg` not `BGAUSS.JPG`

### 4. Organization
- Keep all sponsors in one folder
- Use consistent naming
- Document sponsor tier/category if needed
