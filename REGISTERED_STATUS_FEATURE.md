# Registered Status Feature - Documentation

## Overview
Added functionality to show "Registered" status for events that users have already registered for, across both the Events list page and Event details page.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Event Details Page (`EventDetails.jsx`)

#### Registration Status Check
- Added `isRegistered` state to track if user is registered
- Added `userRegistration` state to store registration details
- Added `checkRegistrationStatus()` function that fetches user's registrations and checks if current event is included

#### Registration Status Banner
When user is registered, a green banner appears showing:
- ✓ "You're Registered!" heading
- Registration Number
- Team Name (if team event)
- Payment Status with color coding:
  - ✓ Completed (green)
  - ⏳ Verification Pending (yellow)
  - ⏳ Pending (orange)

#### Updated Register Button
- Shows "Registered ✓" with green background when user is registered
- Clicking the button navigates to dashboard instead of registering again
- Button is never disabled for registered users
- Uses CheckCircle icon for registered state

### 2. Events List Page (`Events.jsx`)

#### User Registrations Tracking
- Added `userRegistrations` state to store array of registered event IDs
- Added `fetchUserRegistrations()` function that fetches all user registrations
- Automatically fetches registrations when user is authenticated

#### Registered Badge on Event Cards
- Shows green "Registered" badge with CheckCircle icon on event cards
- Badge appears in top-left corner of event image
- Replaces "Featured" badge when user is registered (priority to registered status)
- Only visible when user is authenticated and registered for that event

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/registrations/my-registrations` - Fetches all registrations for logged-in user

### State Management
```javascript
// EventDetails.jsx
const [isRegistered, setIsRegistered] = useState(false);
const [userRegistration, setUserRegistration] = useState(null);

// Events.jsx
const [userRegistrations, setUserRegistrations] = useState([]);
```

### Registration Check Logic
```javascript
const checkRegistrationStatus = async () => {
  try {
    const { data } = await API.get('/registrations/my-registrations');
    const registration = data.registrations.find(reg => reg.event._id === id);
    if (registration) {
      setIsRegistered(true);
      setUserRegistration(registration);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Could not check registration status:', error.message);
  }
};
```

## User Experience

### Events List Page
1. User browses events
2. Events they've registered for show green "Registered" badge
3. Easy visual identification of registered events
4. Can still click to view event details

### Event Details Page
1. User views event they're registered for
2. Green banner appears at top with registration details
3. Register button shows "Registered ✓" in green
4. Clicking button navigates to dashboard
5. All event information remains accessible

## Benefits

1. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Users can instantly see which events they're registered for
2. **Prevent Duplicate Registrations**: Button behavior changes for registered events
3. **Quick Access to Dashboard**: Clicking registered button takes user to dashboard
4. **Registration Details**: Users can see their registration number and payment status
5. **Consistent Experience**: Same registered status shown across all pages

## Styling

### Registered Button (Event Details)
```javascript
className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-xl transition-all duration-300 shadow-lg"
```

### Registered Badge (Events List)
```javascript
className="px-3 py-1 text-xs font-semibold rounded-full flex items-center bg-green-600"
```

### Registration Banner
- Green gradient background: `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.15)`
- Green border: `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.4)`
- Green shadow: `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.2)`

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Not Authenticated**: Registration check only runs when user is logged in
2. **API Failure**: Silently fails with console log, doesn't break UI
3. **No Registrations**: Shows normal register button
4. **Multiple Registrations**: Correctly identifies each registered event
5. **Team vs Individual**: Shows team name only for team events
