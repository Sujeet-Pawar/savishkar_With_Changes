## 📝 Next Steps

### 1. Add Fallback Credentials to .env

Edit `server/.env` and add:

```bash
FALLBACK_EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
FALLBACK_EMAIL_PORT=587
FALLBACK_EMAIL_USER=savishkarjcer2k25@gmail.com
FALLBACK_EMAIL_PASS=ohdvmfdxzpwxytjw
```

### 2. Run Full Test

```bash
cd server
npm run test-fallback-email
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Test 1 (Normal Send): PASSED
✅ Test 2 (Fallback Send): PASSED
Total: 2/2 tests passed
```

### 3. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add fallback email system with automatic failover"
git push
```

### 4. Deploy to Render

Add these environment variables in Render Dashboard:

```
FALLBACK_EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
FALLBACK_EMAIL_PORT=587
FALLBACK_EMAIL_USER=savishkarjcer2k25@gmail.com
FALLBACK_EMAIL_PASS=ohdvmfdxzpwxytjw
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Normal Flow (Primary Works):
```
User Action → Primary Email → ✅ Success
```

### Fallback Flow (Primary Fails):
```
User Action → Primary Email → ❌ Failed
            ↓
    Fallback Email → ✅ Success
```

### Both Fail:
```
User Action → Primary Email → ❌ Failed
            ↓
    Fallback Email → ❌ Failed
            ↓
    Error with details from both
```

## 📊 Email Response Format

The `sendEmail` function now returns:

```javascript
{
  messageId: '<abc123@gmail.com>',
  service: 'smtp-primary',  // or 'smtp-fallback'
  duration: 2340,
  usedFallback: false  // true if fallback was used
}
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Monitor Fallback Usage**
   - Check logs regularly
   - If fallback is used often → Fix primary email

2. **Keep Both Accounts Active**
   - Verify both Gmail accounts have 2FA
   - Keep App Passwords up to date

3. **Test Periodically**
   - Run `npm run test-fallback-email` monthly
   - Verify both accounts still work

4. **For Production**
   - Consider using SendGrid/Mailgun instead of Gmail
   - Gmail has rate limits and may block cloud IPs
